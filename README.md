# WebXR Viewer Javascript

This repo contains the Javascript that implements the WebXR Device API for use *only* in Mozilla's WebXR Viewer.

This is not a polyfill for general use! Do not include it in your projects.

If you need a WebXR polyfill, use [the one provided by the Immersive Web Community Group](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill).

This implementation of WebXR supports a number of features that are non-standard, but are implemented in the WebXR Viewer.  Details can be found in [Extensions.md](Extensions.md).
